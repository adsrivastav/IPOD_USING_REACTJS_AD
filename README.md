# Circular Menu

This project implements a circular menu with navigation functionality, similar to an iPod menu.

## Features

- Click and hold on the circular menu, then move the mouse in a circular fashion inside the menu boundary to navigate through the options.
- Clicking on the "Menu" button takes the user back to the main menu.
- Optionally, submenus can be implemented for specific options (e.g., Music with sub-options like "All Songs", "Artists", etc.).
